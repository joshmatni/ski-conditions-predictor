Project Concept:
Create a machine learning model that predicts the quality of ski conditions at Mount Rose based on 
historical weather data, snowfall, temperature, and wind conditions. The model can classify days 
into categories like "Powder Day," "Groomer Day," or "Poor Conditions."

Steps:
Data Collection:

Gather historical weather data for the Tahoe area (e.g., NOAA, OpenWeatherMap API, or ski-specific sources).
Include snowfall, temperature, wind speed, and any resort-reported condition data (like snow depth).

Data Processing:

Use Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the data.
Create SQL tables to store weather data and resort condition reports for easier querying.

Feature Engineering:

Derive features like temperature trends, storm durations, or wind chill.
Incorporate temporal features (e.g., weekends vs. weekdays).

Modeling:

Use supervised learning (e.g., Random Forest or LightGBM) to predict ski conditions.
Try deep learning (e.g., LSTM) if you include time-series data for weather patterns.

Visualization:

Use Seaborn to create plots like snowfall distributions, correlations, or condition trends over the season.

User Interface:

Build a simple Streamlit or Flask web app where users can input upcoming weather forecasts and get predictions on skiing conditions.

Unique Additions:
Add a recommendation system for optimal skiing times based on your ML predictions and user preferences (e.g., prefers powder days or sunny groomer days).
Integrate live weather updates via an API to keep the tool dynamic.
